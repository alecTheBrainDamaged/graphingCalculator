# Simple Graphing Calculator
Graph algebraic functions. 
Enter a function like 
f(x) = 2 * x 
or 
g(t) = 3 * t
or y = t ^ 2
on the command line 
The OpenGL graphics library will
graph your function on a really
terrible cartesian plane that 
is still in the works. 

Parser is in the app/Main.hs
and not in a seperate module. 
Using megaparsec package for parsing
and gloss for graphics from hackage
the haskell package library.
